Content Management System
*************************

The content management system (CMS) in Axon Ivy is a
hierarchically organized container for content like labels, short texts,
images, source snippets or documents. You can store elements in the CMS
and refer them later in processes or User Dialogs. And you can store
content in multiple languages thus enabling you to internationalize your
processes or applications.

.. note::

   CMS content can be :ref:`overridden <overrides>` in Axon Ivy.
   You can use this feature to customize the products you develop with Axon Ivy.
