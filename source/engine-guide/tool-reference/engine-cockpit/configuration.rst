Configuration
-------------


Global Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The view **Global Variables** shows you all global variables which are defined
for every application. They can be configured on the project or set in the
:ref:`app-yaml` file. You can switch the environment at the top. To add a new
variable or edit one click on the :guilabel:`New` or :guilabel:`Pencil` button.
If you do so your change will be written to the :ref:`app-yaml` file. You can
reset a global variable to its environment value by clicking on the
:guilabel:`Reset` button.
