3rd Party Integration
*********************

The basic idea about integrating Axon.ivy with 3rd party systems is
either to invoke an operation on a external system out of an ivy process
(call) or to have a remote system that invokes an operation in Axon.ivy
(being called). There are several ways to implement such an integration.
This chapter will give you an overview.
