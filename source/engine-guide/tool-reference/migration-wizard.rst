Migration Wizard
----------------------------

Then Migration Wizard helps you to migrate crucial configurations of an old 
|ivy-engine| into your new |ivy-engine| environment.

The Wizard is expected to be run from a fresh downloaded and yet untouched |ivy-engine|. 
Please consult the :ref:`migration` chapter for details instructions when to use the wizard on your operating system.

**Start**

#. :ref:`Start <control-center>` a new yet untouched |ivy-engine|.
#. Browse to URI where the engine runs: e.g. http://localhost:8080 .
#. Choose ``Setup Wizard`` -> ``Migration Engine`` in your Browser.
   
**Usage**

#. Provide the old |ivy-engine| installation directory to the Migration Wizard.
#. Run the MigrationTasks.
#. The wizard may asks for your consent to select the best migration scenario for you.
#. Restart the |ivy-engine|.
