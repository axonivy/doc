Testing
=======

Writing test code has a bad reputation, however they can make your life much
easier. Think about the following points:

- Tests can make the **functionality of a software reliable**

- **Quality** can be maintained

- **Repetitive tasks** can be reduced to a minimum. Let the computer do it!

- Ensure that the software **does what it supposed to do** (e.g after a code
  change or even a platform update).

Write good software without tests is nearly impossible and we want give you the
ability to write tests for your software as easy as possible. Letâ€™s get started!
