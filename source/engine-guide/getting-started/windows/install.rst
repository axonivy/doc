Install the Engine (Windows)
----------------------------

We suggest that you install the Axon Ivy Engine into a new folder called
:file:`ivy\\engine` on one of your drives (e.g. :file:`c:\\ivy\\engine`). Open a
Windows Explorer, navigate to :file:`C:\\` and create those new folders.

Then, navigate to the folder that contains your downloaded engine ZIP archive
and copy :file:`AxonIvyEngine\*.zip` to the newly created folder.

Right click the :file:`AxonIvyEngine\*.zip` file and press :guilabel:`Extract
All ...` from the context menu.

On the appearing dialog, press buton :guilabel:`Extract`. After the extraction
completes, navigate into the new :file:`AxonIvyEngine` folder. The content of
the installation folder looks like this:

.. Hint:: 
  The most important folders in the Axon Ivy Engine installation folder are:

  * :file:`bin` folder contains all the executables
  * :file:`configuration` folder contains the configuration files.
