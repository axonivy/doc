Monitor
-------

The **engine cockpit** gives you the possibility to **monitor** the system
your engine is running on.

Resources
^^^^^^^^^

On the resources page you will have an overview
about cpu load, memory load, network traffic and disk read write. 
In addition, the memory monitor displays the max and current memory usage of the jvm.

Logs
^^^^

The **logs** view shows you the latest entries of the :file:`console.log`,
:file:`config.log` and :file:`ivy.log`. Simply click on the :guilabel:`+` to show the log or
the :guilabel:`-` to hide it. If you want to see the logs of an other day, you
can change the date at the top right.
