"The simplest and safest way to achieve multi-tenancy is to run a separate"

" the following advantages:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/multi-tenancy/multiple-engines.rst:10
msgid ""
"**Security**: A separate installation per customer assures that tenants "
"are isolated on the infrastructure level. It is impossible for a customer"
" to see data from another customer due to programming errors or "
"misconfigurations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/multi-tenancy/multiple-engines.rst:14
msgid ""
"**Scaling**: A separate Axon Ivy Engine per tenant is simple to maintain "
"and scales very well. On the other hand, if you run an Axon Ivy Cluster "
"installation and let all customers run on that cluster, you can add more "
"and more nodes to the cluster to handle the additional load. However, the"
" cluster solution cannot scale infinitely. Because adding more nodes "
"induces more communication between the nodes, the network bandwidth "
"available between the cluster nodes limits its growth potential. Adding "
"more nodes at that point makes the cluster slower."

"**Canary Deployments**: Introducing new features always carries risks. "
