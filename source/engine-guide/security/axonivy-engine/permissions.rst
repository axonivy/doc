Permissions
-----------

Permissions can be used to define who can do what. These can be assigned to
users and roles. Only assign permissions to roles and users that are really
required. We stronlgy recommend to not assign the permission :code:`GRANT ALL`
to the role :code:`EVERYBODY` and always prefer role-based permissions over
user-based permissions.

You can assign permissions to roles and users in the :ref:`Engine Cockpit
<engine-cockpit-security-system>`.
