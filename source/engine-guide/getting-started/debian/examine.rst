Examine the Engine
------------------

After the installation has completed, the engine is automatically started as a systemd
service. You can check the operative state with :code:`systemctl status
axonivy-engine-*`. The output of the service status contains the URL of 
the |ivy-engine| main page.

.. figure:: /_images/engine-getting-started/systemctl-status-axonivy-engine.png

Copy this URL. On your client machine, open a web browser and navigate to that
URL. This will display the |ivy-engine| main page.
