# == OverrideProject ==
#
# You can define an override project where your overriding SubProcesses and HtmlDialogs are located.
# On execution the engine will check if an override exists in the defined project and if so, it gets executed in the declared project context.
# This allows you to place your processes in your base project without having to copy them to your specialized project.
# You can get the project id from the ivy project deployment defintion in the format <group-id>:<project-id>.
