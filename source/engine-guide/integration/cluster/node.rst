Cluster node
============

Runtime
-------

We recommend to operate an Axon Ivy Engine Cluster in a containerized 
environment like Docker or Kubernetes. Create your own Axon Ivy Engine
Docker image with your configuration and your projects packed into it.
To start multiple nodes simply start your own Docker image multiple times.

Restrictions
------------

1. Each node must use the same system databases
2. Each node must use the same external :ref:`ElasticSearch <elasticsearch>` server.
3. Each node must use the same service configurations.
4. Configurations cannot be changed during runtime unless the configuration 
   directory is shared among all nodes.
5. Deployment does not work during runtime unless the application directory 
   is shared among all nodes. If sharing is not possible use auto deployment
   during startup instead.     
   
Most of the restrictions can be solved by using a containerized environment.   

Cluster Name
------------

If you want to run multiple clusters in the same network (same broadcast
domain). Each single cluster needs a unique name so that they don't interfere 
with each other. 

The name of the cluster can be configured in the :ref:`ivy.yaml <ivy-yaml>` file.

Node Name
---------

The :ref:`Engine Cockpit <engine-cockpit-cluster>` has a view that displays all 
running nodes. The name of the node is auto generated by default but can optionally 
be configured in the :ref:`ivy.yaml <ivy-yaml>` file.
