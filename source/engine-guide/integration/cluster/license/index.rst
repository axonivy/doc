Enterprise License
==================

To run the Axon Ivy Engine in a cluster (Enterprise Edition), an enterprise
license is required. The information needed to request this license is the same
as for licensing the Standard Edition :ref:`license`, except that you must also
specify the number of cluster nodes.


Cluster Nodes
-------------

Each node added to an Axon Ivy Engine Cluster incurs an additional license fee.
As a result, the number of nodes in your cluster is limited by the terms of your
license.

.. warning::
   If you add more nodes to your cluster than your license allows, any unlicensed
   nodes will respond with the error code :code:`503 Service Unavailable`.
