Preparation:

#. Download the latest |ivy-engine| hotfix version that matches your main
   release :dev-url:`/download`
#. Stop the running |ivy-engine| instance.
#. Rename the directory of the previously installed |ivy-engine|: e.g., from
   ``opt/ivy/engine-8`` to ``opt/ivy/engine-8_backup805``
#. Unpack the hotfix version of the |ivy-engine| into the directory where the
   previous instance has been running: e.g., to ``opt/ivy/engine-8``.
