3rd Party Integration
*********************

The basic idea of integrating Axon Ivy with 3rd party systems is either to
invoke an operation on a external system out of an Ivy process (call; Axon Ivy is the client) or to have
a remote system invoke an operation in Axon Ivy (being called; Axon Ivy is the server). There
are several ways to implement these integrations.

Before integrating a 3rd party system, you should have a look at the
:ref:`Axon Ivy Market <market>` which may already provide a connector for it.
