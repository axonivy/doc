Migration
=========

The migration process from one |ivy-engine| version to another differs 
highly among the supported operating systems and the kind of migration.

**Hotfix Upgrade**

If you are looking for the steps update to keep your |ivy-engine| on the
latest patch level (e.g. ``8.0.6`` > ``8.0.13``), 
please consult the :ref:`migration-upgrade-engine-hotfix` chapter.

**Major Upgrade**

When you aim for a migration to another major version (e.g. ``8.0`` > ``9.2``),
please consult the :ref:`migration-upgrade-engine-major` chapter.
