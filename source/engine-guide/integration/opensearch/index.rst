OpenSearch
==========

Axon Ivy Engine is using OpenSearch for providing full-text searches and
statistics. OpenSearch itself is :ref:`bundled <opensearch-bundled>` with
Axon Ivy Engine. For systems with high load or using Axon Ivy :ref:`cluster`, you may
need to run an :ref:`external <opensearch-external>` OpenSearch instance.
