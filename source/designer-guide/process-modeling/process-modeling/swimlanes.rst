Swimlanes
---------

.. figure:: /_images/process-modeling/swimlanes.png

Processes can be visually structured by using *pools* and *lanes*. Pools
and lanes are colored background swimlanes with a label that is placed
*behind* the process logic. Swimlanes can have a *horizontal* or
*vertical* orientation.

Swimlanes are available for all process kinds and are typically used to
visualize organizations, roles, responsibility assignments or systems
for process elements or sections of process logic.

A pool or lane can be widened or narrowed by dragging it's border/edge
with the mouse. By default, the position of process elements lying
outside the modified lane are adjusted accordingly. By pressing the
``Shift-Key`` during the drag, you can omit the automatic adjustment of
process elements.

.. note::

   Please note, that pools and lanes do not have any *syntactical*
   meaning whatsoever; their purpose is purely semantical. A pool or
   lane is *not* a container that elements are placed in or associated
   with. They are simply a structured "coloring" of the process'
   background; they do not grow or shrink when you change the processes
   logic and need to be adjusted manually.
