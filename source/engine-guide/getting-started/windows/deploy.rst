Deploy a project
----------------

Let's deploy an Axon Ivy project to the Axon Ivy Engine. Download 
the :dev-url:`demo application </maven/com.axonivy.demo/ivy-demos-app/13.1/zip>`
and drop it in :file:`[engineDir]/deploy` folder. Refresh the main
page of the Axon Ivy Engine. There will be a new section for this deployed app. 

Congratulations you have installed and configured your first Axon Ivy Engine and
deployed your first Axon Ivy project.
