Configuration
=============

An |ivy-engine| Cluster node is setup the exact same way as stand-alone |ivy-engine|.
Note that all nodes in a cluster setup must run within the same network (the same
broadcast domain).

Cluster Name
------------

If you want to run multiple clusters within the same network (same broadcast domain),
you need to name each cluster with a unique name. Only then it is guaranteed that
the clusters don't interfere with each other.

The name of the cluster can be configured in the :ref:`ivy.yaml <ivy-yaml>` file.

Node Name
---------

The :ref:`Engine Cockpit <engine-cockpit-cluster>` has a view that displays all 
running nodes. The name of a node is auto-generated by default but can be configured
in the :ref:`ivy.yaml <ivy-yaml>` file.
