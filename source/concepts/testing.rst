Testing
=======

Writing test code has a bad reputation, however they can make your life much
easier. Think about the following points:

- Tests can make the **functionality of a software reliable**

- **Quality** can be maintained

- **Repetitive tasks** can be reduced to a minimum. Let the computer do it!

- Ensure that the software **does what it supposed to do** (e.g after a code
  change or even a platform update).

Write good software without tests is nearly impossible and we want give you the
ability to write tests for your software as easy as possible. Letâ€™s get started!


Web Testing
-----------

Consider the following use case: You have build a workflow app containing
multiple user dialogs. Do you really want to click always through the full
process, if you maybe change a part of it? At least you should make sure that
the functionality (happy path) of this process is still ensured.

**Web Integration tests** will always follow the same steps and can be highly
automated.


How to write a Web Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step in writing your own web tests is to create a new test project.

.. tip::

  The following guide is based on a :github-build-examples:`demo project <>` and
  uses the name ``crm`` for the project to be tested and the name
  ``crmIntegrationTests`` for the one containing the tests. 
  
  Since this documentation only shows how to setup a test project and perform a
  simple test, you should take a look at the demo project.
  

Setup test project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following step-by-step instructions show you how to create a new test
project:

#. Add a new Axon.ivy Project

   - Enter the same name as the ``crm`` project but with a name postfix (e.g:
     ``crmIntegrationTests``)

   - Make the ``crmIntegrationTests`` project depending on the
     ``crm`` project. Do so by select the the project ``crm`` as **Required
     Project** inside the creation wizard *(or later over: Definitions ->
     Deployment -> Required Projects)*.

#. Convert Projects to Maven Projects

   - Convert both projects (``crm`` and ``crmIntegrationTests``) to Maven
     Projects. *(Right click on the project -> Configure -> Convert to Maven
     Project)*.

#. Define a test source directory

   - Open the :github-build-examples:`.classpath </crmIntegrationTests/.classpath#L28-L33>`
     file. This can be found if you disable the ``.* resource`` filter inside
     the Project Tree (or open the file directory from the *File Explorer*).
     
     
   - Add the following lines to the :file:`.classpath` file:

     .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-setup-classpath.xml
        :language: xml

   - Add a new folder :file:`src_test` to the ``crmIntegrationTests`` project *(Right
     click on the project -> New -> Folder)*

#. Add test util dependencies

   - Open the :github-build-examples:`pom.xml </crmIntegrationTests/pom.xml#L25-L41>`
     file of the ``crmIntegrationTests`` project *(Right click on pom.xml or Deployment
     -> Open With -> Maven POM Editor)* 
    
   - Add the following dependency and repository to the :file:`pom.xml` file:

     .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-setup-pom.xml
        :language: xml

#. Add a test class

   - Create a new class (e.g :github-build-examples:`WebTestRegistrationForm
     </crmIntegrationTests/src_test/ch/ivyteam/integrationtest/WebTestRegistrationForm.java>`)
     inside of the :file:`src_test` folder *(Right click on 'src_test' -> New ->
     Class, e.g 'WebTest' as name)*
   
   - Add the following code inside:

     .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-setup-test.java
        :language: java

#. Run test

   - Make sure the engine is started with your projects

   - To run this test right-clicking inside this class -> Run As -> JUnit Test

   - A new **JUnit** View should have been opened and the test should be green.


Write Web Test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's start by extending our test class added above with a
:github-build-examples:`real test implementation
</crmIntegrationTests/src_test/ch/ivyteam/integrationtest/WebTestRegistrationForm.java#L22-L39>`.
First we need to start a process (you can use the ``EngineUrl`` utility from the
:ref:`web-tester` to do this). 

This process opens a dialog with two input fields (``firstname`` and
``lastname``) and a submit button. After submitting, a second dialog with your
inputs is displayed. 

.. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-test-extend.java
  :language: java

.. figure:: /_images/testing/webtesting-run.gif

.. tip::

  The :ref:`@IvyWebTest <web-tester>` annotation can be configured (e.g to choose your ``browser``
  or change if it should be started ``headless``).


Select, Do and Check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's take a look how this test works. Basically, there are three things
you need to know:

- **Select** an element
- **Do an action** with this selected element
- **Check a condition** on this selected element


Select
""""""

To work with a **single element** you must first select the correct one.
Normally you can use the ``By.id`` selector for this:

.. code-block:: java

  $(By.id("form:submit")); //Find element by id selector

.. tip::

  To evaluate the real id of an element you can use the **Developer Tools** of
  your browser.

  There are much more options how you can use selectors, e.g you
  can select multiple elements:

  .. code-block:: java

    $$(By.cssClass("ui-outputlabel")); //Find all <p:outputLabel> elements
  
  Take a look at the :github-build-examples:`demo project
  </crmIntegrationTests/src_test/ch/ivyteam/integrationtest/WebTestOrderForm.java#L114-L156>`
  to see what else is possible.


Do an action
""""""""""""

On the selected element you can perform some actions:

.. code-block:: java

  $(By.id("form:submit")).click();            //click on button
  $(By.id("form:lastname")).clear();          //clear input field
  $(By.id("form:lastname")).sendKeys("Test"); //set input value


Check a condition
"""""""""""""""""

On your selected element you can check some conditions too (e.g is the element
*visible* or contains a specific *value*):

.. code-block:: java

  $(By.id("form:lastname")).shouldHave(value("Test")); //input field should have value "Test"

.. tip::

  You can check multiple conditions on an item or you can check something
  before perform an action on the item:

  .. code-block:: java

    //button should be enabled before click on it
    $(By.id("form:submit")).shouldBe(enabled).click();
    //<h:outputText> element should be visible and have text "Unit Test"
    $(By.id("form:newCustomer")).shouldBe(visible, text("Unit Test"));

  Take a look at the :github-build-examples:`demo project
  </crmIntegrationTests/src_test/ch/ivyteam/integrationtest/WebTestOrderForm.java#L164-L181>`
  to see what else is possible.


Run automated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's look at how you can run your web tests automated
(:ref:`continuous-integration`). This is important if you want fast feedback on
breaking changes, maybe introduced by a team member. 


.. _webtesting-maven-build:

Module build
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both projects needs to be compiled in the same run. For this we need firstly to
setup a maven module build:

#. Create maven module

   - Delete projects ``crm`` and ``crmIntegrationTests`` from your Designer
     workspace.
   - Open your workspace folder and move both projects into an new folder, e.g
     :file:`compile-test`

   - Add :file:`pom.xml` file into :file:`compile-test` folder.

   - Add following to the :github-build-examples:`pom.xml </pom.xml>`
     file (ensure the correct **modules** ``crm`` and ``crmIntegrationTests`` are
     set):

     .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-maven-module.xml
        :language: xml

   - Your :github-build-examples:`folder structure <>` should look like the
     following:

     .. code-block:: none

        workspace/
          compile-test/
            crm/
            crmIntegrationTests/
            pom.xml

#. Run module build in IDE

   - In your Designer open the **Import** Wizard, then **Existing Maven
     Projects**

   - Select :file:`compile-test/pom.xml` with sub projects (``crm`` and
     ``crmIntegrationTests`` should be visible here) and click **Finish**

   - Right-click on ``compile-test`` -> Run As -> Maven build

   - Set **Goals** to ``clean verify`` and click **Run**

   - This should trigger a run which starts with something like:

     .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-maven-run.log
        :language: none

     But it ends with some **Errors**. To fix those let's continue with the next
     steps.


Run integration tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run our tests within a maven build, we need to start an engine, deploy the
``crm`` project to it, and then stop the engine after the tests are finished. We can
define these steps in the :github-build-examples:`pom.xml
</crmIntegrationTests/pom.xml>` file of our ``crmIntegrationTests`` project:

#. Set :github-build-examples:`test sources dir
   </crmIntegrationTests/pom.xml#L44-L45>` and :github-build-examples:`test
   application name </crmIntegrationTests/pom.xml#L14-L16>`
   
   .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-maven-init.xml
      :language: xml

#. :github-build-examples:`Start </crmIntegrationTests/pom.xml#L52-L58>`
   an engine

   .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-maven-start.xml
      :language: xml

#. :github-build-examples:`Deploy </crmIntegrationTests/pom.xml#L59-L70>`
   our ``crm`` project to the engine

   .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-maven-deploy.xml
      :language: xml

   .. tip::

     In the demo project we use the :github-build-examples:`dependency plugin
     </crmIntegrationTests/pom.xml#L102-L113>` to evaluate the **deployFile**
     attribute.

#. :github-build-examples:`Stop </crmIntegrationTests/pom.xml#L71-L77>`
   the engine after the tests are finished

   .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-maven-stop.xml
      :language: xml

#. Add the :github-build-examples:`test runner plugin </crmIntegrationTests/pom.xml#L80-L101>`

   .. literalinclude:: includes/webtesting-maven-surefire.xml
      :language: xml

#. Run module build in IDE

   - Try to run the module build as before in second step of the
     :ref:`webtesting-maven-build` section. The build should now succeed.

Selenium
^^^^^^^^

Selenium is open source and works across different browsers and platforms. To
communicate with the browser, selenium provides the **WebDriver** specification. 

In our tests we use the `Selenide <https://selenide.org/>`_ (`GitHub
<https://github.com/selenide/selenide>`_, `API
<https://selenide.gitbooks.io/user-guide/content/en/selenide-api/selenide.html>`_)
framework, which is based on the Selenium WebDriver. If youâ€™re more familiar
with plain Selenium tests the following comparison can give you a quick overview
about the differences and benefits: `Selenide vs Selenium
<https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/Selenide-vs-Selenium>`_. Or you can
simply write your tests with the normal Selenium API by accessing the driver
object:

.. code-block:: java

  WebDriver driver = WebDriverRunner.getWebDriver();


.. _web-tester:

Web-Tester
^^^^^^^^^^

With the `web-tester <https://github.com/axonivy/web-tester>`__
we provide you the annotation ``@IvyWebTest``, which sets up the browser
connection for you. It can be configured with some parameters:

.. code-block:: java

  //Default (same as simple @IvyWebTest)
  @IvyWebTest(browser = "firefox", headless = true, reportFolder = "target/selenide/reports")

- **browser**: The browser which should run the test e.g: chrome, firefox, ie,
  phantomjs, htmlunit, safari, opera

- **headless**: Controls if the browser should start with a UI or not.

- **reportFolder**: Automatic screenshots will be taken, when a test fails. This
  folder defines where they are saved.
