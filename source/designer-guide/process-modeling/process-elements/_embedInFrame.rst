You can open the follow up UserDialogs in full-screen rather than in 
the iFrame frontend view (e.g. portal, dev-wf-ui)
by using the ``embedInFrame`` custom field. This is useful if
you want to display a task or a start in a separate window.

``embedInFrame`` is a String value which can be either ``true`` or
``false``.
