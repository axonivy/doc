Enterprise License
==================

You need an enterprise license to run |ivy-engine| as a Cluster (|ivy-engine| Enterprise Edition). 

The information needed to request an enterprise license are the same 
as for a Standard Edition :ref:`license`.

Cluster Nodes
-------------

Each node that you add to |ivy-engine| Cluster costs an additional license fee. 
Therefore, the number of nodes in your Cluster is limited by the license.

.. warning:: 
  If you add more nodes to your Cluster than your license 
  was issued for then the nodes that are not licensed correctly will respond with
  error code :code:`503 Service Unavailable`.
