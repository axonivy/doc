Configuration
=============

An |ivy-engine| Cluster node is setup the exact same way as stand-alone |ivy-engine|.
Note that all nodes in a cluster setup must run within the same network (the same
broadcast domain).

Cluster Name
------------

If you want to run multiple clusters within the same network (same broadcast domain),
you need to name each cluster with a unique name. Only then it is guaranteed that
the clusters don't interfere with each other.

The name of the cluster can be configured in the :ref:`ivy.yaml <ivy-yaml>` file.

Node Name
---------

The :ref:`Engine Cockpit <engine-cockpit-cluster>` has a view that displays all 
running nodes. The name of a node is auto-generated by default but can be configured
in the :ref:`ivy.yaml <ivy-yaml>` file.

.. _cluster-configuration-changes:

Changes
-------

Configuration changes are only applied to the local cluster node where the change is done. 
E.g., an administrator is using the :ref:`Engine Cockpit <engine-cockpit>` to change a 
configuration setting then the setting is only changed at the cluster node where the 
current session of the administrator is executed. On all other cluster nodes, the setting 
is still the old one! 

We recommend that you do not change the configuration at runtime. 
Instead use a :ref:`container image <cluster-container>` that contains the right configuration. 
If you have to change the configuration create a new container image with the new configuration.

Another solution is to share the configuration folder between all cluster nodes.
