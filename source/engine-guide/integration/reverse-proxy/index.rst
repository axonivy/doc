Reverse Proxy
=============

The purpose of a reverse proxy (or frontend web server) is to provide a single
point of entry for one or more services from outside the network. The reverse
proxy receives all requests from the clients and forwards them to the |ivy-engine|
which handles them. This allows to integrate the processes and
applications that you are running on an |ivy-engine| into a company or web
portal. The use of a reverse proxy provides more security. The reverse proxy can
and must be updated at any time to receive the latest security updates, because
this is also the entry point for attackers. In addition, access to critical
resources such as the Engine Cockpit can be blocked.

We always recommend to run a productive |ivy-engine| behind a reverse proxy.
You should terminate the SSL traffic (HTTPS) on the reverse proxy and let the
reverse proxy communicate with the |ivy-engine| over plain HTTP, because the
setup is more easy and this will also increase the performance.

It's still possible to use AJP as the protocol between the reverse proxy and the
|ivy-engine|, but this is deprecated and will be removed in future versions
of |ivy-engine|. Start using HTTP or HTTPS instead of AJP.

We have described how to integrate the |ivy-engine| with the following
reverse proxy servers:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    nginx/index
    apache-httpd/index
    microsoft-iis/index

Read carefully how to improve security by :ref:`restricting the access
<reverse-proxy-secure>` to an |ivy-engine| when using a reverse proxy. Some
reverse proxy servers provides :ref:`Single Sign-on (SSO) <single-sign-on>`
functionality. The reverse proxy then is responsible to authenticate the user.

The Engine Cockpit is providing :ref:`web server view
<engine-cockpit-web-server>` for debugging purpose while integrating a reverse
proxy.

.. rubric:: Base URL

Beside the setup of the reverse proxy itself you always need to configure the
base url in the :ref:`ivy.yaml <ivy-yaml>`. The |ivy-engine|
will use this configuration to create absolute links that are accessible
to clients (e.g. for links in :ref:`task mails <standard-process-email>`).

   .. code-block:: yaml

      # sample ivy.yaml that configures the base url for clients.
      # https://acme.com will be the absolute URL prefix for links generated by |ivy-engine|.
      BaseUrl: https://acme.com
