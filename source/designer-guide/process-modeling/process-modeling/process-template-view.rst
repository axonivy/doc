Process Template View
---------------------

The process template view displays the currently defined process
templates. A *process template* is essentially a selection of process
elements which are stored under a specific name. Once defined, process
templates can be inserted into any existing process, either by drag and
drop or by selection from a dialog. New process templates can be added
to the template store by pressing 't' on a selection of elements in the
:ref:`process-editor-selection-menu`.
