Examine the Engine
------------------

After the installation has completed, the engine is automatically started as a systemd
service. You can check the operative state with :code:`systemctl status
axonivy-engine-*`. The output of the service status contains the URL of 
the Axon Ivy Engine main page.

Copy this URL. On your client machine, open a web browser and navigate to that
URL. This will display the Axon Ivy Engine main page.
