Elasticsearch
=============

|ivy-engine| is using Elasticsearch for providing full-text searches and
statistics. Elasticsearch itself is :ref:`bundled <elasticsearch-bundled>` with
|ivy-engine|. For systems with high load or using |ivy| :ref:`cluster`, you may
need to run an :ref:`external <elasticsearch-external>` Elasticsearch instance.
