Prepare your Machine
--------------------

Before starting with the installation of the Axon Ivy Engine prepare your Linux
machine with the necessary software and tools needed for the installation (wget,
unzip, Java 11 runtime). Most distributions have these tools pre-installed but
especially certain Docker images may not. On Debian (e.g. Ubuntu, etc.) based
system use::

    apt update
    apt install sudo wget unzip openjdk-11-jre-headless
