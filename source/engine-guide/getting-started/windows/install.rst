Install the Engine
------------------

We suggest that you install the |ivy-engine| into a new folder called
:file:`ivy\\engine` on one of your drives (e.g. :file:`c:\\ivy\\engine`). To do
so open a Windows Explorer and navigate to :file:`C:\\` and create those new
folders. Then, navigate to your temporary download folder and copy the file
:file:`AxonIvyEngine\*.zip` to the newly created folder.

Right click the :file:`AxonIvyEngine\*.zip` file and press :guilabel:`Extract
All ...` from the context menu.

On the appearing dialog press the :guilabel:`Extract` button. After the
:file:`AxonIvyEngine\*.zip` is extracted navigate into the new
:file:`AxonIvyEngine` folder. The content of the installation folder looks like
this:

.. Hint:: 
  The most important folders in the |ivy-engine| installation folder are:

  * :file:`bin` folder contains all the executables
  * :file:`configuration` folder contains the configuration files.
