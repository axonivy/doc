Deploy a project
----------------

Let's deploy an Axon.ivy project to the Axon.ivy Engine. Simply download
WorkflowDemos and drop it in :file:`[engineDir]/deploy` folder. Refresh the main
page of the Axon.ivy Engine. There will be a new section for this deployed app. 

Congratulations you have installed and configured your first Axon.ivy Engine and
deployed your first Axon.ivy project.
