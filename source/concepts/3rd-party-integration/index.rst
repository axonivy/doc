3rd Party Integration
*********************

The basic idea about integrating Axon Ivy with 3rd party systems is
either to invoke an operation on a external system out of an ivy process
(call) or to have a remote system that invokes an operation in Axon Ivy
(being called). There are several ways to implement such an integration.

Before you integrate a 3rd party system you should have a look in the
:ref:`Axon Ivy Market <market>` which may already provide a connector for it.
