OpenAPI
===============

Axon Ivy Engines serve REST endpoints, allowing third-parties
to interact with the engine.

The endpoints can be examined in the :api-browser-url:`OpenAPI Browser<default>`.
Note that there are :api-browser-url:`security-system <default>` endpoints 
and :api-browser-url:`system <system>` wide endpoints for deployment, 
which can be selected on the top-right corner.
