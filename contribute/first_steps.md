# Weblate Bestpractice

Here, you will find a quick introduction to how to use Weblate to take Axonivy to a new level of internationalization. 
Further and much more detailed information can be found in the [Weblate documentation](https://docs.weblate.org).

## üåè Become a member

Please create an [Weblate onboard issue](https://github.com/axonivy/doc/issues/new/choose) here and fill in the following information so that we can add you as a member.

As soon as you have been accepted, you will receive a mail with write-access to our translation project.
The project [axonivy](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/axonivy/) is freely accessible, so you can check the translate-status at any time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è First settings

1. Jump in your profile -> settings -> chapter languages
2. Choose the languages you can translate to. 
These will be offered to you on the dashboard for easier access to your chosen translations.
3. Also choose languages you can understand in the second chapter, strings in those languages will be shown in addition to the source string.
4. You should find in the chapter team the project `axonivy` (if you're already a member of the Team `axonivy-translator`).
5. Search for [axonivy](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/axonivy/) on the toolbar and jump in our project.
6. You will find on the right site an eye, enable it. The axonivy-project is now listed in the top dropdown list `projects`.
As well you have now the possibility to get various notifications on this project. You'll find the notification settings in your profile. 

## üìÅ Project and Components of [Axonivy](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/axonivy/).
In the project, you have a first overview of all components that need to be translated.

1. Choose the first component that you love to translate.
2. Here you have as well an overview of all working translation and their translate-status of this component. 
3. You could create a new translation language on the plus symbol on the left corner or jump in an existing one (adding language is not possible for the component `doc`).

## ü¶æ Machine-Translation 

At the very first, get help from the machine-translator. The machine-translater will create the best suggestions for you.

1. You will find the Translator in the Register Tools > Automatic Translator. 
2. Choose the `automatic Translation mode` to `Add as suggestion` and the `search filter` to `untranslated Strings`.
Enable `Machine Translator` and choose `Libre Translate` for the best effort. 
3. Apply and in the background, you'll receive the first suggestions.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Start with translation

Choose your language and click on the translate button on the right.
There are two input fields in the editor the one above is the original text that needs to be translated in the under input field.
On the right side, you'll find some information about the context of this string. Be aware sometimes it needs to understand in which context this string is for a correct translation. For example: `sun` could be the star or maybe a shortcut for `Sunday`.

In the under section there is a register in which you can comment if you need help. And also are there suggestions from other translators or from our machine translation which we started before.

If you're happy with the translation click on `save and continue` and go for the next string.
