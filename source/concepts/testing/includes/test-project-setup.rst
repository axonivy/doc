.. _test-project-setup:

To get started we have to create a test project. The 'Axon.ivy Test Project' 
wizard will help you to setup a test project with all the required 
configurations and a simple sample test.

#. Add a new Axon.ivy Test Project

   - Right click on a projet you would like to cover with Tests.
     Select: New -> Axon.ivy Test Project in the context menu.

   - Pick the test flavour |TESTKIND| to include in the 'New Axon.ivy Test Project' wizard.

   - Finish the wizard. A sample test will be included in the ``src_test`` 
     directory of the just created project.
