User Interface
**************

There are different ways to implement your dialog pages. If you have
standard workflow forms etc. your way is to implement :ref:`user-dialogs`.
If you only have an application based
view, which don't need process or task data you want to use JSF in a
:ref:`static page <static-jsf-pages>`. You can use this pages as end
page in a workflow too.

For a more legacy way you can also use plain HTML or JSP :ref:`user-interface-web-page`
to display a end page.
