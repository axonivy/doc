Getting Started
***************

This chapter helps you getting started with the |ivy-engine|. You will learn how
to install and configure the Engine and finally, how to deploy your Axon.ivy
projects. If you are a Windows user and used to install and configure software
using the UI then the first section :ref:`Windows <getting-started-windows>` is
a good starting point for you. If you are an experienced Linux user and you are
used to install and configure software using the console then the second section
:ref:`Linux <getting-started-linux>` is the right starting point for you. Note,
that on both systems, Windows and Linux, |ivy-engine| can be installed and
configured using the UI or the console. The |ivy-engine| also runs in a
container environment like :ref:`getting-started-docker`.
