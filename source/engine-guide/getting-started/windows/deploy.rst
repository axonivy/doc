Deploy a project
----------------

Let's deploy an Axon Ivy project to the |ivy-engine|. Download
the :dev-url:`demo application </permalink/lib/|version|/demos.zip>`
and drop it in :file:`[engineDir]/deploy` folder. Refresh the main
page of the |ivy-engine|. There will be a new section for this deployed app. 

Congratulations you have installed and configured your first |ivy-engine| and
deployed your first Axon Ivy project.
