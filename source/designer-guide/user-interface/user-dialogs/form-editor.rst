Form Editor (Alpha)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Form Editor allows you to build User Interfaces fast with minimal technical knowledge.

Accessibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Axon IvyProject Tree -> double click on the *Form* node of an HTML Dialog.  
If there is none, create a new HTML Dialog and select the type 'Dialog Form' on the first wizard page.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drag components form the `Components` view on the left and drop them on the center area in order
to add them to an existing form.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having a component selected, you can define its features within the `Properties` view on the right.

Toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The editors toolbar on top offers the following actions:

- **collapse**: the `Components` or `Properties` view to get more space to view and arrange the form contents in the center.
- **display**: changes the view to be rendered in other view-ports, such as large office screens or vertical mobile-devices.
- **download**: the `Download` button shows the technical form json contents. This enables you to copy and paste changes manually from existing forms.
- **grid**: toggles margins between the components, wide margins are for a simple drag and drop experience, while minimal margins are close to the real rendering look.
- **theme**: toggle between dark and white mode to comply with your current dailight environment.
