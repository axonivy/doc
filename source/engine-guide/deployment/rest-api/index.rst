REST API
========

The |ivy-engine| comes with :api-browser-url:`REST deployment API <system>`
which can be used to deploy new applications or projects. It can be inspected
with the :ref:`integration-rest-api-browser`.

The REST deployment API makes highly customized deployment chains possible. However, the 
:ref:`Engine-Cockpit <engine-cockpit-application-detail>` and the 
:ref:`deployment-maven-plugin` provide simpler interfaces for well known use-cases.
