Start the Engine
----------------

Navigate to the :file:`bin` folder and double click on the
:file:`ControlCenter.exe` file to start the Control Center. You can use this
tool to start and stop the |ivy-engine| in different ways (as Windows Service,
as normal user process, with a console window). Select the |ivy-engine| and
press the green play button to start the |ivy-engine| as a normal user process:

.. Hint::
  You can use the Control Center also to register |ivy-engine| as Windows
  Service. Moreover, you can add other existing Windows Services to the list of
  Engines to start and stop them with the Control Center. For example, if you
  have installed your database server on the same machine you can add the
  Windows Service of the database server. To register |ivy-engine| as
  Windows Service you need to **run the Control Center as Administrator**.

After the |ivy-engine| has beend started a web browser is opened and the main
page of the |ivy-engine| is displayed.
