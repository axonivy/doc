Prepare your Machine
--------------------

Before starting with the installation of |ivy-engine| prepare your Linux
machine with the necessary tools and software needed for the installation (wget,
unzip, Java 11 runtime). Most distribution may have pre-installed these tools but
especially certain Docker images may have not. On Debian (e.g. Ubuntu, etc.)
based system use::

    apt update
    apt install sudo wget unzip openjdk-11-jre-headless
