Examine the Engine
------------------

After the installation the engine will automatically be started as systemd
service. You can check the operative state with :code:`systemctl status
axonivy-engine-*`. The output of the service status will expose an URI where
the Axon Ivy Engine page is accessible.

.. figure:: /_images/engine-getting-started/systemctl-status-axonivy-engine.png

Copy this URL. On your client machine open a web browser and navigate to that
URL. This will display the Axon Ivy Engine main page.
